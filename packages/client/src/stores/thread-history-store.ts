/**
 * Thread navigation history — tracks the sequence of threads the user has
 * visited so Alt+Left / Alt+Right can walk through them (à la VSCode's
 * "Go Back" / "Go Forward").
 *
 * Shape: `past` holds visited entries in order; the last element is the
 * currently active thread. `future` holds entries that were popped off
 * `past` by a back navigation, ready to be restored by a forward navigation.
 * A normal user navigation (route change that doesn't match the last entry
 * in `past`) pushes onto `past` and clears `future`.
